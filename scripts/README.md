# Database Seeding Scripts

This directory contains scripts for populating the database with test/dummy data.

## Seed Data Script

### Overview
The `seedData.js` script populates the database with sample courses, batches, and students for development and testing purposes.

### Usage

#### Seed the database with dummy data:
```bash
npm run seed
```

#### Delete all data from the database:
```bash
npm run seed:delete
```

Or run directly with Node:
```bash
# Seed data
node scripts/seedData.js

# Delete all data
node scripts/seedData.js --delete
# or
node scripts/seedData.js -d
```

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** The seed script will **DELETE ALL EXISTING DATA** before inserting new data. Use with caution in production environments!

üîê **Default Password:** All seeded students have the password: `password123`

### Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct database configuration:
```env
LOCAL_DATABASE_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/student_batch
```

### Testing the Seeded Data

After seeding, you can test the API with the following credentials:

```bash
# Login as John Doe
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "john.doe@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Script fails with connection error
- **Solution:** Ensure MongoDB is running and the `LOCAL_DATABASE_URI` in `.env` is correct

**Issue:** Duplicate key error
- **Solution:** Run `npm run seed:delete` first to clear existing data, then run `npm run seed`

**Issue:** Permission denied
- **Solution:** Make sure the script has execute permissions: `chmod +x scripts/seedData.js`
